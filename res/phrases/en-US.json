  "royalRansomIntro0" : "For this mission our goal is to collect enough coins to help a friend of mine, King Max. Why would a king need more gold? Doesn't he already have some royal treasure? He did, until an evil dragon came and destroyed most of the kingdom! He used all his gold to help rebuild it. I don't think I'm brave enough to face a real dragon... Me neither! How about you, __USERNAME__?",
  "royalRansom1Intro0" : "Guys, our friend King Max needs our help again! This time it's Princess Anna's pet puppie that bandits stole while he was playing outside. Have you ever had any pets you really love, __USERNAME__?",
  "royalRansom2Intro0" : "Guys, this is our biggest royal mission yet! The sneaky bandits managed to kidnap King Max himself while he was sleepwalking in the royal gardens! Do you know anyone who walks or talks in their sleep, __USERNAME__?",
  "royalRansomIntro1" : "While King Max's three princess daughters were helping the villagers, bandits kidnapped them! Those dirty dogs will only release them if they receive payments of gold coins! That's terrible! We need to help! First we'll look for coins in an ancient temple, then take it across the ocean until we reach King Max's kingdom. ",
  "royalRansom1Intro1" : "King Max is still short on gold, and his guards are having trouble finding the secret bandit hideout, so we'll have to help gather gold to rescue Sir Bedivere. Don't worry Sir Bedivere, we're on our way!",
  "royalRansom2Intro1" : "The bandits want more coins than ever before, but this time I think we can save King Max and finally catch all those bandits! It's about time they get caught and taught a lesson! Lead the way, big brother!",
  "ancientTempleIntro0" : "Woah! This old temple is gigantic! I've heard that the password to open the entrance  it is very obvious. Can you think of an easy password?",
  "ancientTemple1Intro0" : "This temple is impressive! I wonder what civilization from the past built it!",
  "ancientTemple2Intro0" : "What a cool temple! It must have been kind of neat to live in there, right?",
  "ancientTempleIntro1Yes" : "I think that's it! ",
  "ancientTempleIntro1No" : "That's not right. How about… Password! ",
  "ancientTemple1Intro1" : "Hey, __USERNAME__. If you could go back in time, when would that be?",
  "ancientTemple2Intro1" : "Hey, __USERNAME__. If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?",
  "ancientTemple1Intro2" : "The people who lived in this temple didn't have internet, did they? Poor things... Alright, let's enter the temple!",
  "ancientTemple2Intro2" : "This temple was nice before, but now I get it's full of bugs and dust! Let's head inside and find out!",
  "templeHallsIntro0" : "Okay, the treasure halls should be deep inside the temple. It doesn't look like anyone has been here in forever. You are not afraid of snakes, are you?",
  "templeHalls1Intro0" : "Don't worry, guys. This temple is tricky but I know where I'm going.. I think. You trust me, right?",
  "templeHalls2Intro0" : "Alright guys, let's find that that treasure room! What do you think we'll find?",
  "templeHallsIntro1" : "Don't worry, just follow my lead!",
  "templeHalls1Intro1" : "Well, you haven't let us down before, big brother! Let's go!",
  "templeHalls2Intro1" : "Dibs on any shiny gems! Oh, and fancy jewelry!",

  "exclamation5" : "We're doing great!",
  "treasureTombsIntro0" : "So these are the  treasure tombs. Pretty cool! I could buy my own life-size doll house with all these artifacts! Hey, what's this old inscription here say? Those who of our treasures take will soon regret their big mistake... Uh oh! That sounds like a warning to me! Do you believe in ancient curses, __USERNAME__?",
  "treasureTombsIntro1Yes" : "Me too!",
  "treasureTombsIntro1No" : "Well I do!",
  "treasureTombsOutro0" : "We made it!",
  "templeEscapeIntro0" : "I'm tired already! When I get home I'm taking a nice bubble bath... That sounds nice. What do you like to do to have fun and relax, __USERNAME__?",
  "templeEscapeIntro1" : "You can do that after our adventure because I think I hear the temple gate closing! We need to get out of here, and fast! I bet there are even more boobie traps up ahead, but that won't stop us!",
  "ancientTempleFinaleIntro0" : "We're close, but we have to go faster! I'll going to stop calling out what is up ahead, so listen closely and respond correctly!",
  "ancientTempleFinale1Intro0" : "I'm going to run ahead and make sure the gate is open! That means you'll have to avoid obstacles by sound alone. Good luck!",
  "ancientTempleFinale2Intro0" : "There are too many obstacles up ahead for me to shout out! From now on you'll have to listen for them yourself. You can do it!",
  "ancientTempleOutro0" : "The gate is almost shut! Let's slide under just in time by shouting 'woohoo!' Ready…. Now",
  "ancientTempleOutro1No" : "Oh no! You didn't slide! By not sliding you hit the  gate and dropped some coins. Luckily, I was able to pull you under just in time!",
  "ancientTempleOutro1Yes" : "Awesome! You slid perfectly, which means we made it out with all our treasure!",
  "pirateBayIntro0" : "Time to get across Pirate Bay! What better way than with our own ship? Hey, what should we name our ship this time? Got any good ship name ideas, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBay1Intro0" : "Here we are in Pirate Bay! And guess what, you'll be the captain of our ship! Do you have a cool captain name for yourself, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBay2Intro0" : "Smell the salty air? It means we're in pirate bay! I love it! Do you have a favorite smell, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBayIntro1" : "Not bad!  You'll be the captain while I'll be your lookout, which means I'll let you know if we're approaching something dangerous.",
  "pirateBay1Intro1" : "Alright, captain! It'll be up to you to steer the ship and keep us on course!",
  "pirateBay2Intro1" : "I used to like flowers... until a bee stung me on the nose!",
  "outToSeaIntro0" : "These waters be treacherous, cap'n! Have you ever been on a ship or boat before?",
  "outToSea1Intro0" : "Cap'n, we're all ready to set sail! You don't get sea sick, do you?",
  "outToSea2Intro0" : "Let's start making our way out to sea, cap'n! By the way, do you know how to swim?",
  "outToSeaIntro1" : "Either way, be sure to care for our vessel by keeping it safe!",
  "outToSea1Intro1" : "At least here you can just lean over the side of the ship if you need to puke!",
  "outToSea2Intro1" : "Don't worry about me. I brought my pool floaties just in case.",
  "perilousWatersIntro0" : "Fine sailin', Cap'n! Now that we be in perilous seas. I just hope there aren't any sharks! Anyone else here afraid of sharks?",
  "perilousWaters1Intro0" : "Ah, the open sea! Have you ever gotten a good smell of the ocean, cap'n?",
  "perilousWaters2Intro0" : "We're out in open waters now! Maybe we'll see a whale! I hope we find dolphins! What about you?",
  "perilousWatersIntro1" : "I think they'll be the least of our worries up ahead!",
  "perilousWaters1Intro1" : "It smells like grandpa's anchove pizza to me...",
  "perilousWaters2Intro1" : "Let's just hope we don't run into a big sea monster!",
  "shipwreckBayIntro0" : "We're near our destination, cap'n! Give me a loud 'ay ay!' if you think we'll make it safe and sound!",
  "shipwreckBay1Intro0" : "We're near land, cap'n, but we're in the most dangerous area yet! I say we turn back now! Who's with me?",
  "shipwreckBay2Intro0" : "Careful, guys! They don't call this area Shipwreck Bay for nothing! Don't worry, I trust our captain! You'll get us through this place, right?",
  "shipwreckBayIntro1" : "That's the spirit!",
  "shipwreckBay1Intro1" : "Don't worry, Lily! Our captain will guide us to our destination! Let's go!",
  "shipwreckBay2Intro1" : "There's only one way to find out. Here we go!",
  "pirateBayFinaleIntro0" : "We're approaching heavy fog, cap'n! You'll have to listen to oncoming obstacles without me calling them out! Let's go!",
  "pirateBayFinale1Intro0" : "I can't see a thing from the crow's nest with all this sea fog! Cap'n, you'll have to listen for what's coming up ahead yourself! Good luck!",
  "pirateBayFinale2Intro0" : "There's too much fog for me to help! Use your ears and listen carefully to know what's up ahead! You can do this, cap'n!",
  "kingdomChaseIntro0" : "Here we are in Fantasy Kingdom. What's the coolest building you've ever visited, __USERNAME__?",
  "kingdomChase1Intro0" : "We made it to King Max's kingdom! This place is awesome! Do you know any magic words?",
  "kingdomChase2Intro0" : "This is fantasy kingdom! It has a village, a castle, and even dragons! If you could learn any language, what would it be, __USERNAME__?",
  "kingdomChaseIntro1" : "That sounds like a neat... Oh no! A clumsy thief has stolen all our hard-earned coins! Let's chase him and get it back!",
  "kingdomChase1Intro1" : "Nice! Maybe we can... Hey! That thief took our stuff! After him!",
  "kingdomChase2Intro1" : "Someday I want to make up my own language so I can whisper to myself and no one knows what I'm saying! Hey! Stop, you thief! Those are our coins! Let's get him!",
  "theVillageIntro0" : "The thief is trying to lose us in the village! Think he'll get away?",
  "theVillage1Intro0" : "I can't wait to catch that thief and turn him in to the village authorities! What do you think they'll do to him?",
  "theVillage2Intro0" : "We need to catch this thief before he gets away! Why do you think he stole from us?",
  "theVillageIntro1" : "Not on my watch! Lets nab that jerk!",
  "theVillage1Intro1" : "A few hours of public shaming should do the trick. Anyone bring some tomatos or rotten eggs?",
  "theVillage2Intro1" : "Whatever the reason, it's still wrong. Let's get him!",
  "castleGroundsIntro0" : "Oh man! Now he's running toward the castle! I hope we see the royal gardens! Do any of you have a favorite flower?",
  "castleGrounds1Intro0" : "Wow, he's fast! Even the castle guards can't keep up! That thief is pretty in shape! What do you guys do for exercise?",
  "castleGrounds2Intro0" : "The thief is taking us to the castle grounds! I bet he'd love to steal some stuff from inside! What valuable things do you think they keep inside the castle?",
  "castleGroundsIntro1" : "I think the king likes roses so we'll need to be careful!",
  "castleGrounds1Intro1" : "He's just lucky I don't have my bike. Let's go!",
  "castleGrounds2Intro1" : "Whatever is inside, he's not getting it! Let's catch him!",
  "dragonValleyIntro0" : "Yikes! All our commotion has attracted a dragon. Uh oh! Maybe we can feed it something so it doesn't eat us! Do you know what food dragons like?",
  "dragonValley1Intro0" : "This thief is crazy! He's running straight into Dragon Valley! Cool! What mythical creature do you wish really existed?",
  "dragonValley2Intro0" : "The thief thinks he can hide from us in Dragon Valley! We all have our favorite hiding place, right? Do you have one?",
  "dragonValleyIntro1" : "Right now we're on the menu!",
  "dragonValley1Intro1" : "I'd want a beautiful unicorn!",
  "dragonValley2Intro1" : "No matter where he hides, we'll find him!",
  "kingdomChaseFinaleIntro0" : "The thief is picking up speed! Instead of me saying what's ahead, just listen closely for what the thief runs into. Let's go!",
  "kingdomChaseFinale1Intro0" : "Uh oh, I'm getting tired! You take the lead and listen closely for upcoming obstacles. You've got this!",
  "kingdomChaseFinale2Intro0" : "We have to run faster to finally catch the thief! From now on, just listen to the obstacles so you can avoid them. Let's go!",
  "pirateBusinessIntro0" : "Time to set sail on our first swashbuckling adventure! Have you ever imagined that you were a pirate, __USERNAME__",
  "pirateBusiness1Intro0" : "Great job last time, crew! Captain Seadog looks very happy with his new hat! That hat was pretty valuable! I hope he doesn't bury it or something... Where would you bury your pirate treasure, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBusiness2Intro0" : "Alright, mateys! Captain Seadog has his beloved crew back by his side! Of course, they can't journey out to sea without a ship. Where in the world would you sail with your own ship, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBusinessIntro1" : "Our first mission is to help my matey Captain Seadog. He's a good pirate like us. But sadly, evil pirates recently left him stranded on an island. We can inspire him by helping him get back out to sea! First we'll collect coins to get him a new captain hat! Let's go!",
  "pirateBusiness1Intro1" : "This time our goal is to gather enough coins to help Captain Seadog hire back his old crew. Arr, it'll be like a pirate family reunion! Let's do it!",
  "pirateBusiness2Intro1" : "The old ship is not gone, sis, but badly damaged. If we collect enough coins we can help repair his precious ship. We can do it!",
  "tikiQuartetIntro0" : "Believe it or not but I have tiki friends that sometimes come to life! They say they were made of a magical wood long ago. In fact, all three of them loved playing their favorite instruments until someone took them to sell at a museum. Is there an instrument you know how to play or want to learn, __USERNAME__?",
  "tikiQuartet1Intro0" : "Tiki Ten is happy to have his bamboo xylophone back! Now let's help buy Tiki Barry's beloved drum. They were given to them long ago by their precious tiki moms, duh! Do you have something special that your mom or dad gave you, __USERNAME__?",
  "tikiQuartet2Intro0" : "Good job last time, guys! Tiki Ten and Tiki Barry have their instruments back. Now we need Tiki Mezzo's ukelele. The treasure hunter accidentally broke this one, which means it's going to cost more to buy and repair. Have you ever broken something you really liked, __USERNAME__?",
  "tikiQuartetIntro1" : "First, let's collect coins to buy back Tiki Ten's bamboo xylophone. I love how it sounds when he plays it!",
  "tikiQuartet1Intro1" : "He'll have his drum back soon enough, thanks to us! Let's go!",
  "tikiQuartet2Intro1" : "I'm sure we'll find enough coins on our next adventure! Let's get to it!",
  "powerupUsed" : "Wow, that looked like __POWERUP__.",
  "powerupGot" : "Wow, nice comeback! You've got __POWERUP__ to use during this scene."
