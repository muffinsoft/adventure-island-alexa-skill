Lily: Those meanies! I bet they'll only release her if King Alex pays them a lot of gold, right? Ben: Right! But since he already spent all his gold on the village, King Max is counting on us to help him collect all 60 COINS save his daughter. We'll need 5 COINS in each area we come across. Let's get started!",

King Max: Anna! It's good to be back, and it's all thanks to you friends. King Max: For helping to rescue me, I give you my grandest nickname of all: CHAMPION OF THE KING. Ben: Wow!

  "pirateBay1Intro0" : "Here we are in Pirate Bay! And guess what, you'll be the captain of our ship! Do you have a cool captain name for yourself, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBay2Intro0" : "Smell the salty air? It means we're in pirate bay! I love it! Do you have a favorite smell, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBayIntro1" : "Not bad!  You'll be the captain while I'll be your lookout, which means I'll let you know if we're approaching something dangerous.",

  "perilousWaters1Intro0" : "Ah, the open sea! Have you ever gotten a good smell of the ocean, cap'n?",
  "perilousWaters2Intro0" : "We're out in open waters now! Maybe we'll see a whale! I hope we find dolphins! What about you?",
  "perilousWatersIntro1" : "I think they'll be the least of our worries up ahead!",
  "perilousWaters1Intro1" : "It smells like grandpa's anchove pizza to me...",
  "perilousWaters2Intro1" : "Let's just hope we don't run into a big sea monster!",

He must be pretty sad. How can we help him? Ben: We can inspire him by helping him get back out to sea! First we'll need to collect 60 COINS to get him a new captain hat! Should be no problem if we get 5 COINS in each area. Let's get started!",
  "pirateBusiness1Intro1" : "Ben: This time our goal is to gather enough coins to help Captain Seadog hire back his old crew. They're more expensive than a pirate hat, so this time we'll need 120 COINS. Lily: Arr, it'll be like a pirate family reunion! Ben: We only need 10 COINS from each area. Let's go!",
  "pirateBusiness2Intro1" : "Lily: What happened to his old ship? Is it gone? Ben: It's not gone, sis, but badly damaged. If fact, we'll need a whopping 180 COINS to repair his precious ship. But we can do it! All we need is to get 15 COINS in each area. Follow me!",
  "pirateBusinessOutro0" : "Ben: A grand adventure, if I do say so myself! Let's go find Captain Seadog! Captain Seadog: Ahoy, Ben and friends! Lily: Ahoy! Alexa: Your turn to say hello, sailor!",

Alexa: Hey SEA VOYAGER, if you could have any hat, what would it look like?",
  "pirateBusiness2Outro0" : "Ben: That was our most epic adventure yet! Let's get these coins to Captain Seadog! Captain Seadog: Ahoy, SHIPMASTER and mateys! What news do ya bring? Ben: Captain! We have enough coins to repair your trusty ship! Captain Seadog: Shiver me timbers! That's wonderful! Those evil pirates better start sayin' their prayers! Captain Seadog: For your help, I'm letting you rename my ship! Alexa: Got any good ideas, SHIPMASTER?",
  "pirateBusinessOutro1" : "Ben: Captain, we need you to get back out to sea! To help, we've collected coins to buy you a new hat! Captain Seadog: Arrr, is that so? Mighty kind o' ya! It just so happens I have a pirate hat catalog with me right now! Lily: Cool, can I take a look?! Captain Seadog: I know it ain't much but for your help, I bestow upon thee the nickname SEA VOYAGER.

Lily: No way! I'll believe it when I see it! Ben: You will! In fact, all three of them loved playing their favorite instruments until someone took them to sell at a museum. Alexa: I have a question for you, brave explorer. Is there an instrument you know how to play or want to learn?",
  "tikiQuartet1Intro0" : "Ben: Tiki Ten is happy to have his bamboo xylophone back! Now let's help buy Tiki Barry's beloved drum. Lily: I don't see why we can't just buy other instruments for them.

  "tikiQuartet2Intro0" : "Ben: Good job last time, guys! Tiki Ten and Tiki Barry have their instruments back. Now we need Tiki Mezzo's ukulele. Lily: No problem! I'm sure it'll cost the same as the other instruments, right? Ben: Not exactly. The treasure hunter accidentally broke this one, which means it's going to cost more to buy and repair. Alexa: Hey, TIKI PATHFINDER, Have you ever broken something you really liked?",
  "tikiQuartetIntro1" : "Ben: First, let's collect 60 COINS to buy back Tiki Ten's bamboo xylophone. I love how it sounds when he plays it! We'll make it if we grab 5 COINS in each area. Let's get started!",
  "tikiQuartet1Intro1" : "Ben: The museum raised their prices, so we'll need 120 COINS to get the jungle drum back. Not at problem if we get 10 COINS in each area. Let's go!",
  "tikiQuartet2Intro1" : "Ben: Since it's the last instrument, the museum raised their price even more! We'll need 180 COINS to buy the ukulele! That means we need to get 15 COINS in each area. We can do it! Follow me!",
  "tikiQuartetOutro0" : "Ben: What a cool adventure! Hey, we've got enough coins for Tiki Ten's bamboo xylophone! I already sent the coins to buy it. Let's go find him behind the temple. Ben: Hey Tiki Ten! Alexa: Your turn to say hello, explorer!",
