  "welcome" : "Have you ever been on a treasure hunting adventure? Let's go on one together! First, we'll gather as many gold coins as we can in an ancient temple full of all sorts of traps. If we live through that, we'll try to take our loot across an ocean swarming with  sea monsters and evil pirates.  Then, we’ll need to watch out for sneaky thieves when we arrive to a fantastical kingdom with dragons and castles! Say 'find treasure' to start your adventure",
  "rootIntro0" : "I am Ben. What’s your name?",
  "rootIntro1" : "Nice name!  I'm going on a treasure hunting adventure and I could use a partner. What's the coolest place you've ever visited?",
  "rootIntro2" : "Well I hope you're ready to explore ancient temples, sail the seven seas, and even visit a fantasy kingdom!",

  "coinNotPicked" : "Looks like you've missed it.",
  "sceneConfirm" : "We made it! Lucky us!",
  "sceneFail" : "You were hit too many times, we will not be able to do this. Would you like to restart the scene or try your luck in another mission?",

  "coinPlural" : "coins",
  "royalRansomIntro0" : "For this mission our goal is to collect enough coins to help a friend of mine, King Max. Why would a king need more gold? Doesn't he already have some royal treasure? He did, until an evil dragon came and destroyed most of the kingdom! He used all his gold to help rebuild it. I don't think I'm brave enough to face a real dragon... Me neither! How about you, __USERNAME__?",
  "royalRansomIntro1" : "While King Max's three princess daughters were helping the villagers, bandits kidnapped them! Those dirty dogs will only release them if they receive payments of gold coins! That's terrible! We need to help! First we'll look for coins in an ancient temple, then take it across the ocean until we reach King Max's kingdom. ",
  "ancientTempleIntro0" : "Woah! This old temple is gigantic! I've heard that the password to open the entrance  it is very obvious. Can you think of an easy password?",
  "ancientTempleIntro1Yes" : "I think that's it! ",
  "ancientTempleIntro1No" : "That's not right. How about… Password! ",
  "templeHallsIntro0" : "Okay, the treasure halls should be deep inside the temple. It doesn't look like anyone has been here in forever. You are not afraid of snakes, are you?",
  "templeHalls1Intro0" : "Don't worry, guys. This temple is tricky but I know where I'm going.. I think. You trust me, right?",
  "templeHalls2Intro0" : "Alright guys, let's find that that treasure room! What do you think we'll find?",
  "templeHallsIntro1" : "Don't worry, just follow my lead!",
  "templeHalls1Intro1" : "Well, you haven't let us down before, big brother! Let's go!",
  "templeHalls2Intro1" : "Dibs on any shiny gems! Oh, and fancy jewelry!",
  "demoPrompt" : "I am ready. How about you, __USERNAME__? If not, say 'Lily first' to see how it's done! Or if you're ready, say 'I'm ready!'",
  "readyPrompt" : "Ready to go, __USERNAME__? If not, say 'Help' to see how it's done! Or, if you're ready, say 'I'm ready!'",

  "exclamation4" : "Keep running! We can't stop yet!",
  "exclamation5" : "We're doing great!",
  "treasureTombsIntro0" : "So these are the  treasure tombs. Pretty cool! I could buy my own life-size doll house with all these artifacts! Hey, what's this old inscription here say? Those who of our treasures take will soon regret their big mistake... Uh oh! That sounds like a warning to me! Do you believe in ancient curses, __USERNAME__?",
  "treasureTombsIntro1Yes" : "Me too!",
  "treasureTombsIntro1No" : "Well I do!",
  "treasureTombsOutro0" : "We made it!",
  "templeEscapeIntro0" : "I'm tired already! When I get home I'm taking a nice bubble bath... That sounds nice. What do you like to do to have fun and relax, __USERNAME__?",
  "templeEscapeIntro1" : "You can do that after our adventure because I think I hear the temple gate closing! We need to get out of here, and fast! I bet there are even more boobie traps up ahead, but that won't stop us!",
  "ancientTempleFinaleIntro0" : "We're close, but we have to go faster! I'll going to stop calling out what is up ahead, so listen closely and respond correctly!",
  "ancientTempleFinale1Intro0" : "I'm going to run ahead and make sure the gate is open! That means you'll have to avoid obstacles by sound alone. Good luck!",
  "ancientTempleFinale2Intro0" : "There are too many obstacles up ahead for me to shout out! From now on you'll have to listen for them yourself. You can do it!",
  "ancientTempleOutro0" : "The gate is almost shut! Let's slide under just in time by shouting 'woohoo!' Ready…. Now",
  "ancientTempleOutro1No" : "Oh no! You didn't slide! By not sliding you hit the  gate and dropped some coins. Luckily, I was able to pull you under just in time!",
  "ancientTempleOutro1Yes" : "Awesome! You slid perfectly, which means we made it out with all our treasure!",
  "pirateBayIntro0" : "Time to get across Pirate Bay! What better way than with our own ship? Hey, what should we name our ship this time? Got any good ship name ideas, __USERNAME__?",
  "pirateBayIntro1" : "Not bad!  You'll be the captain while I'll be your lookout, which means I'll let you know if we're approaching something dangerous.",
  "outToSeaIntro0" : "These waters be treacherous, cap'n! Have you ever been on a ship or boat before?",
  "outToSea1Intro0" : "Cap'n, we're all ready to set sail! You don't get sea sick, do you?",
  "outToSea2Intro0" : "Let's start making our way out to sea, cap'n! By the way, do you know how to swim?",
  "outToSeaIntro1" : "Either way, be sure to care for our vessel by keeping it safe!",
  "outToSea1Intro1" : "At least here you can just lean over the side of the ship if you need to puke!",
  "outToSea2Intro1" : "Don't worry about me. I brought my pool floaties just in case.",
  "perilousWatersIntro0" : "Fine sailin', Cap'n! Now that we be in perilous seas. I just hope there aren't any sharks! Anyone else here afraid of sharks?",
  "perilousWaters1Intro0" : "Ah, the open sea! Have you ever gotten a good smell of the ocean, cap'n?",
  "perilousWaters2Intro0" : "We're out in open waters now! Maybe we'll see a whale! I hope we find dolphins! What about you?",
  "perilousWatersIntro1" : "I think they'll be the least of our worries up ahead!",
  "perilousWaters1Intro1" : "It smells like grandpa's anchove pizza to me...",
  "perilousWaters2Intro1" : "Let's just hope we don't run into a big sea monster!",
  "shipwreckBayIntro0" : "We're near our destination, cap'n! Give me a loud 'ay ay!' if you think we'll make it safe and sound!",
  "shipwreckBay1Intro0" : "We're near land, cap'n, but we're in the most dangerous area yet! I say we turn back now! Who's with me?",
  "shipwreckBay2Intro0" : "Careful, guys! They don't call this area Shipwreck Bay for nothing! Don't worry, I trust our captain! You'll get us through this place, right?",
  "shipwreckBayIntro1" : "That's the spirit!",
  "shipwreckBay1Intro1" : "Don't worry, Lily! Our captain will guide us to our destination! Let's go!",
  "shipwreckBay2Intro1" : "There's only one way to find out. Here we go!",
  "pirateBayFinaleIntro0" : "We're approaching heavy fog, cap'n! You'll have to listen to oncoming obstacles without me calling them out! Let's go!",
  "pirateBayFinale1Intro0" : "I can't see a thing from the crow's nest with all this sea fog! Cap'n, you'll have to listen for what's coming up ahead yourself! Good luck!",
  "pirateBayFinale2Intro0" : "There's too much fog for me to help! Use your ears and listen carefully to know what's up ahead! You can do this, cap'n!",
  "theVillageIntro0" : "The thief is trying to lose us in the village! Think he'll get away?",
  "theVillage1Intro0" : "I can't wait to catch that thief and turn him in to the village authorities! What do you think they'll do to him?",
  "theVillage2Intro0" : "We need to catch this thief before he gets away! Why do you think he stole from us?",
  "theVillageIntro1" : "Not on my watch! Lets nab that jerk!",
  "theVillage1Intro1" : "A few hours of public shaming should do the trick. Anyone bring some tomatos or rotten eggs?",
  "theVillage2Intro1" : "Whatever the reason, it's still wrong. Let's get him!",
  "castleGroundsIntro0" : "Oh man! Now he's running toward the castle! I hope we see the royal gardens! Do any of you have a favorite flower?",
  "castleGrounds1Intro0" : "Wow, he's fast! Even the castle guards can't keep up! That thief is pretty in shape! What do you guys do for exercise?",
  "castleGrounds2Intro0" : "The thief is taking us to the castle grounds! I bet he'd love to steal some stuff from inside! What valuable things do you think they keep inside the castle?",
  "castleGroundsIntro1" : "I think the king likes roses so we'll need to be careful!",
  "castleGrounds1Intro1" : "He's just lucky I don't have my bike. Let's go!",
  "castleGrounds2Intro1" : "Whatever is inside, he's not getting it! Let's catch him!",
  "dragonValleyIntro0" : "Yikes! All our commotion has attracted a dragon. Uh oh! Maybe we can feed it something so it doesn't eat us! Do you know what food dragons like?",
  "dragonValley1Intro0" : "This thief is crazy! He's running straight into Dragon Valley! Cool! What mythical creature do you wish really existed?",
  "dragonValley2Intro0" : "The thief thinks he can hide from us in Dragon Valley! We all have our favorite hiding place, right? Do you have one?",
  "dragonValleyIntro1" : "Right now we're on the menu!",
  "dragonValley1Intro1" : "I'd want a beautiful unicorn!",
  "dragonValley2Intro1" : "No matter where he hides, we'll find him!",
  "kingdomChaseFinaleIntro0" : "The thief is picking up speed! Instead of me saying what's ahead, just listen closely for what the thief runs into. Let's go!",
  "kingdomChaseFinale1Intro0" : "Uh oh, I'm getting tired! You take the lead and listen closely for upcoming obstacles. You've got this!",
  "kingdomChaseFinale2Intro0" : "We have to run faster to finally catch the thief! From now on, just listen to the obstacles so you can avoid them. Let's go!"
