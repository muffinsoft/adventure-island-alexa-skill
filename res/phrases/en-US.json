  "pirateBusiness1Intro1" : "Lily: Good idea! Don't forget to make a map so you remember how to find it later! Ben: This time our goal is to gather enough coins to help Captain Seadog hire back his old crew. They're more expensive than a pirate hat, so this time we'll need 120 COINS.

We have enough coins to repair your trusty ship! Captain Seadog: Shiver me timbers! That's wonderful! Those evil pirates better start sayin' their prayers! Captain Seadog: For your help, I'm letting you rename my ship! Ben: Got any good ideas, SHIPMASTER?",
  "pirateBusiness2Outro1" : "Captain Seadog: I like the sound o' that! For yer help I'm givin' ye the best nickname I can think of: GRAND ADMIRAL. Ye also get me precious PIRATE TREASURE CHEST!

Do you have something special that your mom or dad gave you?",
  "tikiTrouble1Intro1" : "Lily: That's neat! I have a heart necklace from mom and dad. I never leave home without it! Ben: The museum raised their prices, so we'll need 120 COINS to get the jungle drum back. Not at problem if we get 10 COINS in each area. Let's go!",
  "tikiTrouble2Intro0" : "Ben: Good job last time, guys! Tiki Ten and Tiki Barry have their instruments back. We even got an awesome Tiki Mask as a reward! Now we need Tiki Mezzo's ukulele. Lily: No problem! I'm sure it'll cost the same as the other instruments, right? Ben: Not exactly. The treasure hunter accidentally broke this one, which means it's going to cost more to buy and repair. Lily: Hey, TIKI PATHFINDER, Have you ever broken something you really liked?",
  "tikiTrouble2Intro1" : "Lily: Aww. I tore my favorite skirt the other day. I loved it! Ben: Since it's the last instrument, the museum raised their price even more! We'll need 180 COINS to buy the ukulele! That means we need to get 15 COINS in each area. We can do it! Follow me!",

[footsteps] Ben: Hey Tiki Mezzo! Tiki Mezzo: Tiki Mezzo no feel like talking. Not even to TIKI PATHFINDER. Tiki Mezzo sad he doesn't have ukulele... Lily: Aww, I feel bad for him! Ben: Hey, TIKI PATHFINDER. What do you do to cheer yourself up?",
